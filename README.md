## AP's Powder Simulator

It's a powder simulator.

Inspired by:
* [sand:box](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=smellymoo.sand), a mobile game which I discovered when I was younger
* [Mattbatwings' Minecraft powder simulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n1YQ5Gjml4)

Like some of my other projects, this is licensed under Polyform Noncommercial 1.0. Currently, I'll give it occasional updates but I won't make it a major project.
